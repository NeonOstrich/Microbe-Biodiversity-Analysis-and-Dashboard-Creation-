# Microbe-Biodiversity-Analysis-and-Dashboard-Creation-

##Background
This is an assignment that I completed for the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp, focused on analysis in SQL.

##Organization
In this repository, you will find this readme file in addition to a folder labeled "code". Inside of the "code" folder, you will find an html file which runs the code, a JSON file which contains the original data, a screenshot, and a foler labeled "static", which holds a folder named "js" which holds an app file. 

##Analysis
This analysis involves the construction of an interactive dashboard which explores belly button biodiversity. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
